Description: Subgroup classification is a basic task in genomic data analysis,
  especially for gene expression data and methylation data. It can predict
  novel subgroups when there is nothing known about the data or it can test
  consistency between predicted subgroups with known annotations. The cola
  package provides a general framework for subgroup classification by
  consensus clustering. It has following features: 1. It modularizes the
  consensus clustering processes that various methods can be easily
  integrated. 2. It provides rich visualizations for interpreting the results.
  3. It allows running multiple methods at the same time and provides
  functionalities to compare results in a straightforward way. 4. It provides
  a new method to extract features which are more efficient to separate
  subgroups. 5. It generates detailed reports for the complete analysis.
